          This was the question on my mind one day a few weeks ago as I loaded a
          hex bar with 315 lbs of plates. It was my first time deadlifting in
          five years, and in that time, the only strength training I had done
          was strictly bodyweight: push-ups, pull-ups, bodyweight squats,
          planks, hip bridges, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it was time to see if all that calisthenics work would translate
          into deadlift strength. I stepped into the bar, grabbed the handles,
          set my knees and back, and pulled. 315 lbs came up pretty easily. I
          locked out at the top, then set the weight down again under control.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was, and still am, pretty ecstatic about this result. After 5 years
          of nothing but calisthenics, I’ve maintained my ability to pull a
          heavy weight off the floor. My deadlift max as a beginner
          weightlifter, before switching to calisthenics, was also 315. Granted,
          that was with a straight bar and this was with a hex bar (which is
          easier), but still, 315 is a decent pull for a non-lifter no matter
          which bar you use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the lift in the video was after a two-mile run. I’m confident
          that if I tried again with fresh legs, I could hit 335 lbs, possibly
          even more.
        </p>
        <h2>Calisthenics Can Replace the Deadlift After All</h2>
        <p>
          My main takeaway from this experience is that the lower-body
          calisthenics moves that I have been practicing for years are a valid
          substitute for deadlifts. So I can continue to focus on unweighted
          pistol squats, hip bridges, etc. without worrying about losing my
          ability to deadlift heavy.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s interesting about this is that calisthenics is often supposed
          to be inadequate for the lower body, especially when it comes to
          hip-hinge movements. The common idea is that while calisthenics is
          great for building upper-body strength, you need to use external
          weights to build up the big muscles of your legs. This notion
          circulates even among calisthenics advocates. The

            >“Recommended Routine”
          </a>
          on
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/"
            >r/bodyweightfitness</a
          >
          calls for integrating barbell squats and deadlifts into your workouts
          once you can manage one-leg bodyweight squat variations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my little experiment calls this notion into question. Apparently,
          there is a large degree of carryover between standard calisthenics
          moves and the deadlift, at least for me. And if that’s the case, why
          should I add deadlifts to my calisthenics routine?
        </p>
        <h2>Use Calisthenics to Unlock “Free Gains” on the Deadlift</h2>
        <p>
          Philip Chubb articulates a similar point on his excellent
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MindfulMover">YouTube</a> and
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_mindful_mover/">Instagram </a>
          account, Mindful Mover. Chubb calls it “free gains” — the idea is that
          by working on certain exercises, you can make gains in other exercises
          for “free”, that is without working those exercises directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidently, calisthenics has allowed me to make “free gains” in the
          deadlift, and Chubb himself has documented the same thing. He

          of calisthenics-based lower-body training and was able to pull 315 lbs
          on a straight bar.

          Matt Schifferle, another calisthenics-only athlete, performed

          with the same positive result.
        </p>
        <p>Apparently, you don’t need to deadlift to be able to deadlift.</p>
        <h2>Does Calisthenics Translate to Overhead Press Strength?</h2>
        <p>
          Three days after my triumphant deadlift test, I was back in the gym
          looking to see what other “free gains” I had made from calisthenics.
          This time, I wanted to try the overhead press, another lift I hadn’t
          attempted for years. Would my push-up and handstand work carry over as
          extra pressing power?
        </p>
        <p>
          Overhead press was always my weak link as a lifter. I was never able
          to manage more than 135 lbs. Still, I felt confident that I would be
          able to hit at least this number after 5 years of calisthenics
          training. In that time, I had added some visible muscle to my arms and
          torso, muscle which I thought would help me literally raise the bar.
        </p>
        <p>So what happened? I totally failed!</p>
        <p>
          Before trying 135 lbs, I figured I would warm up with lighter weight.
          I did an empty bar (45 lbs) then 95 lbs without issue. Then I added 10
          lbs to either side for a total of 115 lbs and tried that. I managed
          one rep but couldn’t get the bar past my head on the second rep.
        </p>
        <p>
          I racked the weight, paused for a minute to muster my strength, then
          tried again. Same result — I couldn’t get 115 lbs past my chin.
        </p>
        <iframe
          class="video-wrapper short"

          allowfullscreen
          loading="lazy"
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          There was no point in trying 135 lbs if I couldn’t lift a lighter
          weight. The test had failed.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Calisthenics Improved My Deadlift But Not Overhead Press</h2>
        <p>
          I was dismayed by this result, but also a little intrigued. There is a
          plethora of great calisthenics exercises for the upper-body —
          push-ups, pull-ups, dips, rows, handstands — and many of these are
          highly regarded even by iron-worshippers. Nobody doubts that you can
          build a strong upper-body with bodyweight exercises — just look at
          gymnasts! Yet, in my case, years of calisthenics failed to produce
          gains in one of the most basic markers of upper-body strength, the
          overhead press. Meanwhile, the one lift which everyone assumes has no
          calisthenics equivalent, the deadlift, is as strong as ever after
          years of calisthenics-only training. What gives?
        </p>
        <p>
          My current explanation is that calisthenics produces weightlifting
          gains only when it mimics weightlifting with regard to movement and
          range of motion in the joints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the deadlift, which involves straightening of the ankle, knee,
          and hip joints. My observation is that it is actually pretty easy to
          mimic this motion using calisthenics. Both two-leg and one-leg squat
          variations involve the exact same movement at the exact same joints.
          So it’s no wonder that bodyweight squat work seems to carry over as
          deadlift strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overhead press, on the other hand, is a little bit different. Its
          bodyweight equivalents are the pike push-up and handstand push-up.
          These exercises involve the same movement at the same joints: flexion
          of the shoulder and extension of the elbow. However, their range of
          motion is different. During an overhead press, the weight must travel
          from the level to your shoulders past your head until your arms are
          locked out. During a pike push-up or handstand push-up, your head’s in
          the way, meaning that the weight only needs to travel from the top of
          your head to the lock out position.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/blog/will-calisthenics-make-you-a-better-weightlifter/overhead-press-vs-handstand-pushup-range-of-motion.png"
          alt="Overhead press typically has a bigger range of motion than its calisthenics equivalent, the handstand push-up.
"
        />
        <p>
          Put simply, the overhead press has a bigger range of motion than pike
          push-ups and handstand push-ups. This, I think, is why the latter
          exercises don’t translate to the former. The hardest part of an
          overhead press is the bottom part of the motion, i.e. getting the
          weight off your shoulders to the level of your eyes. Crucially, this
          is the exact part of the motion that I wasn’t training with
          calisthenics.
        </p>
        <h2>Follow-Up n=1 Exercise Experiments</h2>
        <p>
          If my theory about calisthenics-to-weightlifting carryover is correct,
          then I should be able to improve my overhead press if I increase the
          range of motion of my pike push-ups. (It’s pretty easy to do this
          using gymnastics rings or a suspension trainer.) To test this out, all
          I have to do is practice increased-ROM pike push-ups for a while then
          head back to the gym to retest my overhead press 1-rep max. I’ll
          report back once I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          My theory also implies that I should be able to improve, not just
          maintain, my deadlift with focused work in bodyweight squats, hip
          bridges, and other exercises involving the same joints and ROM. I’ll
          plan to run this test later. For now, I want to focus my leg training
          on running. More specifically, I want to see whether sprinting
          improves my endurance performance, measured by the time it takes to
          run two miles. My hypothesis is that it will because again — same
          joint movement, same range of motion. I’ll report back on this too.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s to testing things out for yourself.</p>
