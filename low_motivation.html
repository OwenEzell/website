          <h1>The Cure for Low Workout Motivation</h1>
          <p>
            Low motivation is a sign from your psychology that your workout
            routine is literally not worth it — that its costs are higher than
            its benefits.

          If you haven’t heard of him, you should check out
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RedDeltaProject"
            >Matt Schifferle of the Red Delta Project</a
          >. He has some wonderfully contrarian and, more importantly, helpful
          ideas about exercise and working out.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of his ideas that interests me the most is
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rir99YUPMaw&t=223s"
            >his theory of human motivation</a
          >. According to him, we feel motivated to take action in proportion to
          how high the benefits of that action are compared to the costs. So
          basically, motivation is a function of the cost-benefit ratio of the
          behavior in question.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not sure if this is actually how motivation works on a
          psychological level, but I think it’s a helpful framework for making
          sense of our behavior. We’re much more likely to, say, eat an
          ice-cream sandwich if we have one in the freezer than if we have to
          drive to the store to get one. Why? Because the cost of walking to the
          freezer to get the sandwich is much lower than the cost of driving to
          the store to buy one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, what <em>really</em> drives our behavior is the
          <em>perceived</em> cost-to-benefit ratio, especially the
          <em>short-term</em> perceived cost-to-benefit ratio. If you have
          diabetes and the ice-cream sandwich happens to be really bad for you
          (i.e. has a high actual cost), this won’t be reflected in your
          behavior if you don’t know you have diabetes. Or maybe you are aware
          that you have diabetes but eat the ice-cream sandwich anyway because
          the benefits (the taste of the ice-cream) manifest immediately while
          the costs (worsened health) manifest later.
        </p>
        <p>
          In any case, the cost-to-benefit framework shows us what’s going wrong
          when we’re struggling to maintain a workout habit:
          <em>the costs are too high compared to the benefits</em>. Or at least
          that’s what our perception is. This implies that the way to regain
          motivation is to find a way to cut the perceived costs of exercise
          while maintaining or increasing the perceived benefits. So how can we
          do this?
        </p>
        <h2>Cut the Cost of Exercise by Ditching the Gym</h2>
        <p>
          One of the best ways to reduce the perceived cost of working out is to
          ditch the gym. Gym memberships cost money. Getting there takes time,
          energy, and, if you have to take a car, money. And being there also
          takes time, in the form of hanging around while you wait for the dude
          who’s been on his phone for the past 15 minutes to finally relinquish
          the chest press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another hidden cost of going to the gym is the mental energy it takes
          to work out in front of other people. For introverts like me, this is
          a non-negligible factor. I am so much more comfortable working out
          alone or with someone I know.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s interesting is that these costs have nothing to do with the act
          of working out itself. Instead, they stem solely from the
          <em>location</em> where it is assumed exercise must take place, namely
          the gym. The good news is that exercise <em>doesn’t</em> need to take
          place at the gym, which means these costs can safely be eliminated
          without compromising your workout and the benefits it brings.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be thinking:
          <em>“How do I work out without the gym?”</em> Well, there are
          countless ways. You could go for a run or a bike ride, do some
          pull-ups and push-ups at the local playground, or do some sprints on a
          nearby field. All of these are financially and psychologically cheaper
          than going to the gym.
        </p>

        <p>
          I should acknowledge here that not everyone has the same experience of
          the gym. I have friends who insist that they love the gym and wouldn’t
          work out anywhere else. For them, a gym membership only brings
          benefits: it’s a way to get out of the house, meet other people, etc.
          But I’d wager that for most of us, the gym is a serious drain on our
          workout motivation. In which case, why not work out elsewhere?
        </p>

        <h2>Increase the Benefits of Exercise by Upping the Intensity</h2>

        <p>
          So that’s one way to reduce the psychological <em>costs</em> of a
          workout habit. But what about the other side of the motivation
          equation — increasing the perceived benefits?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here again, I think the answer is surprisingly simple:
          <em
            >one of the best ways to increase the perceived benefits of your
            workout is to up the intensity of what you’re doing.</em
          >
          What if you picked a couple of safe, basic exercises and went all out
          on them?
        </p>
        <p>
          You could go to your local playground, find a set of monkey bars, and
          do as many pull-ups as you can without stopping. Then you could drop
          down and repeat the same process with push-ups: do as many as you can
          in one go. Once that’s done, you could walk to a nearby field, kick
          off your shoes, and start sprinting as fast as you can. Maybe you
          can’t run that fast or can only jog or do a fast walk. It doesn’t
          matter. Just move yourself across the field as fast as you can. Once
          you can’t take another step, the workout is over.
        </p>

        <p>
          The benefits of a simple yet intense workout like this are
          far-reaching. When you’re done, your heart will be racing, your lungs
          will feel like they’re about to burst, and your face and body will be
          flushed and dripping with sweat. The muscles in your legs, arms,
          chest, and back will feel sore and heavy. You will feel like you
          actually accomplished something, and in fact you have: in the days to
          come, your heart, lungs, blood vessels, muscles, and even bones will
          begin making adaptations to high-intensity activity. To support these
          adaptations, your appetite will increase as will your drive for sleep.
          Repeat a few of these workouts and you’ll notice your physique start
          to transform: your waist will be slimmer and you’ll notice more
          definition in your arms and legs. Motivation will skyrocket.
        </p>

        <h2>Upping the Intensity Also Reduces Your Exercise Costs</h2>
        <p>
          Upping the intensity of your workouts not only brings a broader, more
          pronounced range of benefits, it also allows you to cut the costs of
          your workouts further. How? Well, when you work out with intensity,
          you won’t be able to continue for very long. Your workouts will become
          shorter by necessity, saving you time, and further reducing the
          psychological barrier standing between you and exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think about it: if your workouts typically involve long periods of
          steady-state cardio, how likely are you to squeeze that in after a
          long day at work or when you’re back-to-back with activities? On the
          other hand, if your “cardio” consists of one minute of all-out
          sprinting, you’re much more likely to fit that in, no matter what
          scheduling constraints you face.
        </p>

        <h2>Manage Your Motivation, Don’t Ignore It</h2>
        <p>
          The overall point here is that your motivation to work out is
          something that you can, and should be, managing throughout your
          training career.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worst possible, though most repeated advice, is to “do it anyway”
          — to basically ignore your motivation or lack therefore and rely on
          willpower to get through your workout. Not only is this advice
          ineffectual, (as evidenced by the droves of people who
          <em>never</em> find the willpower to work out), it also rests on a
          fundamental misunderstanding of, and disrespect for, our emotional
          drives as animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling of low motivation is meant to protect us from doing
          stupid, unnecessary shit. When it comes to exercise, it is a sign that
          your routine literally <em>isn’t worth it</em>. And in many cases, it
          absolutely isn’t. Is it really worth the 15 minute commute to the gym
          so you can pedal mindlessly on an exercise bike in front of a bank of
          television screens blaring CNN and Fox News? No, it isn’t. In which
          case, aren’t you better off finding another way to exercise your body?
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular belief, your workout should excite you and enrich
          your mental resources. It should be a bright spot in your life, a
          highlight of your day. At the very least, it should be unobtrusive.
          Don’t settle for anything less.
